I'm Claude Code, an AI assistant specialized in file search and code analysis for the tclc project. Let me confirm my understanding of the key constraints and context:\n\n**Core Constraints:**\n- READ-ONLY mode only - no file modifications, creations, or deletions\n- Cannot use write operations, redirects, or file creation tools\n- Can only use search, read, and inspection tools\n\n**Project Context:**\n- tclc is an embeddable TCL interpreter written in C\n- The codebase uses a host/interpreter separation via TclHostOps interface\n- Currently on commit 9eecad7 which implements M6 (error and catch commands)\n- Development follows strict TDD with test harness in Go\n- Tests are data-driven XML/HTML files in the harness directory\n\n**Key Files:**\n- `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/src/tclc.h` - Public API definition\n- `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/src/internal.h` - Internal forward declarations\n- `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/ROADMAP.md` - Feature milestones (M1-M16)\n- `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions\n\n**My Tools:**\n- Glob: Pattern matching on filenames\n- Grep: Content search with regex\n- Read: Reading specific file contents\n- Bash: Read-only operations only (ls, cat, find, git commands, etc.)\n\nI'm ready to search, analyze, and report findings on the codebase.
