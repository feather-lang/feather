I've reviewed the context:\n\n- **tclc** is an embeddable TCL interpreter written in C with no stdlib dependencies\n- It uses a host operations pattern where the interpreter delegates all I/O, memory, and data structures to the embedding host\n- The project is structured with:\n  - `src/` containing the interpreter implementation\n  - `harness/` containing the test harness in Go\n  - A test-driven development approach with XML/HTML-based test files\n  - A roadmap with 16 milestones (currently at M8 based on recent commits)\n\nKey architectural principles:\n- Pure C implementation with no direct I/O or allocation\n- Commands receive unevaluated string arguments (like Lisp fexprs)\n- Substitution (variables, commands) happens when code explicitly evaluates them\n- Return codes (TCL_OK, TCL_ERROR, TCL_RETURN, TCL_BREAK, TCL_CONTINUE) propagate through the call stack\n- Heavy emphasis on introspection and metaprogramming capabilities\n\nI understand the working process:\n1. Review the last commit with `git show HEAD`\n2. Consult `src/tclc.h` as the authoritative API source\n3. Use `src/internal.h` for internal forward declarations\n4. Stop immediately if primitive operations in TclHostOps are insufficient\n5. Commit with detailed messages including thinking and current state\n\nI'm in read-only mode and ready to help with code exploration, searching, and analysis.
