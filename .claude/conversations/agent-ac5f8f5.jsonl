I've reviewed the context:\n\n**Project Overview:**\n- tclc is an embeddable TCL interpreter written in stdlib-less C\n- The host provides all memory management and I/O through the TclHostOps interface\n- Uses test-driven development with XML/HTML-based test harnesses\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Main branch with recent changes to `src/builtin_expr.c` and test files\n- Currently at Milestone M7 (Introspection with info command)\n- Just completed M7.1 test cases for expr deviations\n\n**Key Files:**\n- `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/src/tclc.h` - Public API and host interface\n- `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/ROADMAP.md` - Development milestones\n- `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/CLAUDE.md` - Working process instructions\n\n**Critical Working Process Rules:**\n- Always review the last commit in full before starting (`git show HEAD`)\n- Read-only exploration mode - no file modifications\n- @src/tclc.h is the authoritative API source\n- Must stop and ask if TclHostOps primitives are insufficient\n- Commit messages must document all thinking and current state\n\nI'm prepared to search the codebase, analyze implementations, and help with development tasks.
