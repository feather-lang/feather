I understand this is the `tclc` project - a small, embeddable TCL interpreter written in C with a host-based architecture.\n\nKey points I've absorbed from the instructions:\n\n1. **Architecture**: The interpreter is in `src/` (stdlib-less C), the test harness is in `harness/`, and Go host/library code is at the toplevel\n2. **Memory Management**: The host manages all allocation, lifetimes, I/O, and datastructures through the `TclHostOps` interface\n3. **Public API**: `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/src/tclc.h` is the authoritative source for what the interpreter expects from the host\n4. **Development Process**: Strict TDD with progressively more complex tests\n5. **Current Status**: On the `main` branch with a recent commit about parser implementation with leading whitespace skipping\n6. **Critical Constraint**: I am in READ-ONLY mode - I cannot create, modify, or delete any files\n\nI'm ready to help with code exploration, search tasks, and analysis.
