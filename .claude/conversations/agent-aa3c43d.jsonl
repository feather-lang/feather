Let me verify my understanding of the context:\n\n**Project Overview:**\n- `tclc` is an embeddable TCL interpreter written in C\n- It uses a host-provided interface (`TclHostOps`) for all operations (allocation, I/O, data structures)\n- Development follows strict TDD with milestones adding one concept at a time\n- Currently at M16 (Dictionary Support) based on git history\n\n**Key Principles I'll Follow:**\n1. Review `git show HEAD` before any task to understand the current state\n2. Read-only mode: I can only search and analyze code, not modify files\n3. Consult `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/src/tclc.h` as the authoritative API source\n4. `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/src/internal.h` for internal declarations\n5. Must stop immediately if primitives in `TclHostOps` are insufficient\n6. All file paths in responses must be absolute\n7. Efficient search strategies using glob, grep, and read operations\n\n**Current State:**\n- Working branch: `main` (clean)\n- Last commit: `f49d1c2 Implement M16: Dictionary Support`\n- Test harness: XML/HTML data-driven in `harness/`\n- Binaries compiled to `bin/` via `mise build`\n- Tests run via `mise test`\n\nI'm prepared to help with code analysis, search operations, and understanding the codebase.
