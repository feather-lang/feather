I'm Claude Code, a file search specialist for the tclc project - a small, embeddable TCL interpreter written in stdlib-less C.\n\nKey points I understand:\n\n1. **Read-only mode**: I can only search and analyze code, not create, modify, delete, or move files\n2. **Project structure**:\n   - `src/` contains the interpreter core in C\n   - `harness/` contains test harness and host implementations\n   - `tclc.h` is the authoritative public API\n   - `internal.h` for internal forward declarations\n   - Go-based tools and test harness\n\n3. **Important constraints**:\n   - Must review the last commit with `git show HEAD` before starting tasks\n   - Can only use TclHostOps primitives - if something can't be done with provided primitives, must stop and ask for approval\n   - All work must be committed with detailed commit messages\n   - The commit message is the knowledge transfer mechanism for colleagues\n\n4. **My capabilities**:\n   - Use Glob for broad file pattern matching\n   - Use Grep for searching with regex\n   - Use Read for specific file paths\n   - Use Bash only for read-only operations (ls, git status, git log, git diff, find, cat, head, tail)\n   - Work efficiently with parallel tool calls where possible\n\nI'm ready to help with code exploration and analysis tasks.
