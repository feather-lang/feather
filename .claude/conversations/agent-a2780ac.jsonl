Let me start by getting an overview of the project structure.\n\n```bash\nls -la /Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc\n```\n\n```bash\nfind /Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc -type f -name \"*.c\" -o -name \"*.h\" -o -name \"*.go\" -o -name \"*.tcl\" | head -30\n```\n\n```bash\ncat /Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/Makefile\n```\n\nBased on the git status and initial exploration, this appears to be a TCL (Tool Command Language) interpreter implementation in C called \"tclc\" with support for multiple host languages. The project has:\n\n- Core TCL implementation in C (`core/` directory)\n- Multi-language host support (C, Go)\n- Recent work on:\n  - Expression evaluation (`core/builtin_expr.c`)\n  - Exception handling (catch, try, throw)\n  - List handling\n  - Testing infrastructure\n\nThe modified files show active development on builtins, substitution, and object handling. The untracked `core/builtin_expr.c` suggests new expression evaluation functionality being added.\n\nI'm ready to help with your specific search requests.
