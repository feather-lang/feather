This is `tclc`, a small embeddable TCL interpreter written in C. Let me confirm my understanding:\n\n**Key points:**\n- The interpreter is pure C, allocation-managed by the host through `TclHostOps`\n- Tests are data-driven XML/HTML files\n- The project uses `mise` for building and testing\n- Source code is in `src/`, test harness in `harness/`\n- The public API is defined in `src/tclc.h`\n- Current milestone: M7 (while command) based on recent commits\n- Last commit implements argument expansion `{*}` syntax\n\n**Recent implementation status (from git log):**\n- c16c7a9: Argument expansion `{*}` syntax\n- af341ea: Command substitution `[cmd args]`\n- 9fe1ea5: `set` builtin command\n- 1fbc017: Call frames for variable scoping\n- 1d1a20e: Variable substitution\n\n**Key constraints I'm operating under:**\n- READ-ONLY mode only - no file modifications\n- Must use efficient search strategies (glob, grep, read)\n- Report findings with absolute file paths\n- Avoid emojis in communication\n\nI'm ready to help with code exploration, analysis, or debugging tasks.
