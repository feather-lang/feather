Let me verify the setup and familiarize myself with the codebase structure:\n\n**Project Overview:**\n- `tclc` is an embeddable TCL interpreter written in stdlib-less C\n- The project follows a strict TDD approach with data-driven XML/HTML test cases\n- Memory and I/O are managed entirely by the embedder through `TclHostOps`\n- Current milestone: M1 (basic command invocation)\n\n**Key Files:**\n- `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/src/tclc.h` - Public API and host operations interface\n- `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/src/` - Interpreter implementation\n- `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/harness/` - Test harness (Go-based)\n- `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/testcases/` - Data-driven test cases in HTML format\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Latest commit: `f9ebb6e` - \"Implement whitespace tokenization for command arguments\"\n- Working on M1 (simple command invocation)\n- One modified file: `testcases/m1/simple-command-invocation.html`\n\n**Important Constraints:**\n- This is READ-ONLY mode only\n- No file creation, modification, or deletion\n- Memory allocation and all I/O delegated to host\n- Must stop immediately if primitives are insufficient\n\nI'm ready to help.
