This is the tclc project - an embeddable TCL interpreter written in C with a host-delegated architecture. Let me summarize the key points:\n\n**Project Structure:**\n- `src/` - interpreter implementation (stdlib-less C)\n- `harness/` - test harness and host programs\n- `bin/` - compiled binaries (gitignored)\n\n**Key Files:**\n- `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/src/tclc.h` - authoritative public API definition\n- `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/src/internal.h` - internal forward declarations\n- `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/ROADMAP.md` - milestones and implementation status\n- `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/CLAUDE.md` - project instructions\n\n**Current State:**\n- Working directory: `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc`\n- Current branch: `main`\n- Modified file: `src/tclc.h`\n- Last commit: \"Implement semicolons, comments, and full backslash substitution\"\n\n**Development Model:**\n- Host-delegated architecture via `TclHostOps` interface\n- All memory/allocation managed by embedder\n- Pure interpreter (no I/O, no kernel interaction)\n- TDD-driven with XML/HTML test cases\n- Must review commits with `git show HEAD` before starting tasks\n\n**Important Constraint:** I must STOP immediately if the provided primitives in TclHostOps are insufficient for implementing desired functionality and await approval.\n\nI'm ready to help with code analysis and exploration.
