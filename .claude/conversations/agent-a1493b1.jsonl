This is a codebase for tclc, an embeddable TCL interpreter written in C. The project is well-structured with:\n\n- **src/**: Core interpreter implementation (stdlib-less C)\n- **harness/**: Test harness and host programs\n- **bin/**: Compiled binaries (git-ignored)\n\nKey files I should be aware of:\n- `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/src/tclc.h` - Public API and host operations interface\n- `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/ROADMAP.md` - Development milestones (currently at M10: Namespaces)\n- `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions and working process\n\nFrom the git status, I can see the most recent work involves:\n- Namespace export and import commands (commit aa8eeb9)\n- Namespace command resolution (commit 666e19a)\n- Unified command storage with :: prefix (commit 12b555d)\n\nI understand:\n1. This is a **READ-ONLY** exploration task - no file modifications allowed\n2. I should use grep, glob, and read tools efficiently\n3. All paths in responses must be absolute\n4. The project uses `mise` for task management\n5. Tests are data-driven XML/HTML files in the test harness\n\nI'm ready to help with code exploration and analysis tasks.
