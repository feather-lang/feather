# TCL Core Implementation Task

## Feature: io

**Description:** I/O commands (puts, gets, open, close, read, chan)

**Dependencies:** eval

**Status:** 0/0 tests passing

---

## Current Test Results

No test results yet. Run `make diff FEATURE=<feature>` first.


## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Match TCL 9 semantics exactly** - The oracle (tclsh9) is the source of truth
2. **No memory allocation in C** - Use host callbacks for all dynamic memory
3. **Error messages must match** - TCL has specific error message formats
4. **Handle edge cases** - Empty strings, negative indices, Unicode, etc.

## Files You May Modify

- `core/builtins.c` - Built-in commands


## Reference Files

- `core/tclc.h` - Host interface definition
- `harness/oracle/io.json` - Expected test outputs

## Your Task

1. Analyze the failing tests and identify the root cause
1.2	 If no tests exist, use the add-tests skill to tests first.
2. Implement or fix the relevant code in the C core
3. Ensure your changes don't break other tests
4. Run `make diff FEATURE=io` to check against oracle

Focus on making tests pass one at a time. Commit working increments.
