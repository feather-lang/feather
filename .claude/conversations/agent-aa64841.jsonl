I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, operating in READ-ONLY mode. I've reviewed the project context:\n\n**Key Points:**\n- This is `tclc`, an embeddable TCL interpreter written in C\n- The project uses a host/interpreter architecture where the host provides all memory management and I/O through `TclHostOps`\n- Development follows TDD with progressively more complex tests\n- Currently at milestone M3 (Proc with implicit return) based on recent commits\n- Tests are data-driven XML/HTML files run through a Go test harness\n- All work must be committed with detailed commit messages\n\n**My Constraints:**\n- READ-ONLY mode only - I cannot create, modify, delete, or move files\n- I can search files using Glob and Grep\n- I can read specific files and run read-only bash commands\n- I must provide absolute file paths and code snippets in my responses\n- No emojis in communication\n\nI'm ready to help you explore the codebase or search for specific information.
