I understand the context:\n\n**tclc** is an embeddable TCL interpreter written in C with a host-based architecture. Key points:\n\n1. **Structure**: \n   - `src/` contains the interpreter core (stdlib-less C)\n   - `harness/` contains test harness with multiple host implementations\n   - Go tooling in `bin/` managed by `mise`\n\n2. **Design principles**:\n   - All memory/allocation managed by embedder\n   - Operations expressed through `TclHostOps` interface\n   - Test harness is data-driven (XML/HTML files)\n   - No built-in I/O, event loops, or OO features\n\n3. **Current progress**: \n   - M1 phase (simple command invocation)\n   - Latest commit: \"Add trailing whitespace skipping to parser\"\n   - Modified file: `testcases/m1/simple-command-invocation.html`\n\n4. **Key files**:\n   - `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/src/tclc.h` - Public API\n   - `/Users/dhamidi/projects/tclc/src/internal.h` - Internal declarations\n   - `ROADMAP.md` and `CLAUDE.md` - Project guidance\n\nI'm in READ-ONLY mode and can efficiently search and analyze code using glob patterns, regex, and file reading.
