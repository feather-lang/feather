I understand:\n\n1. **Project Structure**: tclc is an embeddable TCL interpreter written in C, with the core interpreter in `src/` and a Go-based test harness in `harness/`.\n\n2. **Key Principles**:\n   - Pure C implementation with no direct I/O, allocation, or kernel interaction\n   - Host-managed memory and operations via the `TclHostOps` interface\n   - Data-driven test harness (XML/HTML based)\n   - Strict TDD development approach\n\n3. **Current Status**: The project has recently implemented:\n   - Argument expansion `{*}` syntax\n   - Command substitution `[cmd args]`\n   - The `set` builtin command\n   - Call frames for variable scoping\n   - Variable substitution\n\n4. **Development Workflow**:\n   - All changes must start with reviewing the last commit via `git show HEAD`\n   - `src/tclc.h` is the authoritative API definition\n   - Internal declarations go in `src/internal.h`\n   - Commits must contain thorough thinking and state documentation\n   - I operate in READ-ONLY mode - no file modifications\n\nI'm ready to help you search and analyze the codebase.
