I've reviewed the project structure:\n\n- **tclc**: An embeddable TCL interpreter written in C, designed to be hosted\n- **Key principles**: \n  - Host controls all memory allocation and I/O\n  - Interpreter expresses needs through `TclHostOps` interface\n  - Test-driven development with XML/HTML data-driven tests\n  - Strict milestone approach where each adds one new execution model concept\n\n- **Current status** (from git log):\n  - M5 return command and M5.1 expr rewrite recently implemented\n  - M4 (control flow with break/continue) completed\n  - Clean working directory on main branch\n\n- **Critical constraints**:\n  - I'm in read-only mode - cannot modify, create, or delete files\n  - Must review `git show HEAD` before starting tasks\n  - Cannot proceed if primitive operations in `TclHostOps` are insufficient\n  - All commits must contain full thinking and current state\n\nI'm ready to help with code exploration, analysis, and understanding of the tclc project.
