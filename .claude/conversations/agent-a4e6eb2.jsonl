I understand the project context:\n\n**tclc** is an embeddable TCL interpreter written in C with a host-delegated architecture. The key points I'm keeping in mind:\n\n- **Pure implementation**: No direct I/O, allocation, or kernel interaction. All operations delegate to the host via `TclHostOps`\n- **Current milestone**: M9 completed (Unified command table with function pointer dispatch) based on the recent commit `b09c396`\n- **Architecture**: \n  - Parser creates token streams\n  - Commands dispatch through a unified table\n  - Frames, variables, and procedures are host-managed\n  - The interpreter is embedded without built-in event loops or I/O\n- **Key files**:\n  - `src/tclc.h` - Public API and host operations interface\n  - `src/internal.h` - Internal forward declarations\n  - `src/` - Interpreter implementation (stdlib-less C)\n  - `harness/` - Test infrastructure and host implementations\n\nI'm operating in **read-only mode** and will help you search the codebase efficiently using glob patterns, grep searches, and file reads to find implementations, understand the architecture, or locate specific functionality.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or analyze?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":12416,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":12416,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWQ1QiePbTo7j9v84kT1n","type":"assistant","uuid":"7704c1df-9ec0-4d42-af51-d105f3de0d52","timestamp":"2025-12-23T17:24:23.320Z"}
