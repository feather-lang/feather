       This command enters the Tcl event loop to process events, blocking the
       application if no events are ready.  It continues processing events
       until some event handler sets the value of the global variable _v_a_r_N_a_m_e.
       Once _v_a_r_N_a_m_e has been set, the vvwwaaiitt command will return as soon as the
       event handler that modified _v_a_r_N_a_m_e completes.  The _v_a_r_N_a_m_e argument is
       always interpreted as a variable name with respect to the global
       namespace, but can refer to any namespace's variables if the fully-
       qualified name is given.

       In the second more complex command form _o_p_t_i_o_n_s allow for finer control
       of the wait operation and to deal with multiple event sources.  _O_p_t_i_o_n_s
       can be made up of:

       ----     Marks the end of options. All following arguments are handled as
              variable names.

       --aallll   All conditions for the wait operation must be met to complete
              the wait operation. Otherwise (the default) the first event
              completes the wait.

       --eexxtteennddeedd
              An extended result in list form is returned, see below for
              explanation.

       --nnooffiilleeeevveennttss
              File events are not handled in the wait operation.

       --nnooiiddlleeeevveennttss
              Idle handlers are not invoked during the wait operation.

       --nnoottiimmeerreevveennttss
              Timer handlers are not serviced during the wait operation.

       --nnoowwiinnddoowweevveennttss
              Events of the windowing system are not handled during the wait
              operation.

       --rreeaaddaabbllee _c_h_a_n_n_e_l
              _C_h_a_n_n_e_l must name a Tcl channel open for reading. If _c_h_a_n_n_e_l is
              or becomes readable the wait operation completes.

       --ttiimmeeoouutt _m_i_l_l_i_s_e_c_o_n_d_s
              The wait operation is constrained to _m_i_l_l_i_s_e_c_o_n_d_s.

       --vvaarriiaabbllee _v_a_r_N_a_m_e
              _V_a_r_N_a_m_e must be the name of a global variable. Writing or
              unsetting this variable completes the wait operation.

       --wwrriittaabbllee _c_h_a_n_n_e_l
              _C_h_a_n_n_e_l must name a Tcl channel open for writing. If _c_h_a_n_n_e_l is
              or becomes writable the wait operation completes.

       The result returned by vvwwaaiitt is for the simple form an empty string. If
       the --ttiimmeeoouutt option is specified, the result is the number of
       milliseconds remaining when the wait condition has been met, or -1 if
       the wait operation timed out.

       If the --eexxtteennddeedd option is specified, the result is made up of a Tcl
       list with an even number of elements. Odd elements take the values
       rreeaaddaabbllee, ttiimmeelleefftt, vvaarriiaabbllee, and wwrriittaabbllee. Even elements are the
       corresponding variable and channel names or the remaining number of
       milliseconds.  The list is ordered by the occurrences of the event(s)
       with the exception of ttiimmeelleefftt which always comes last.

       In some cases the vvwwaaiitt command may not return immediately after
       _v_a_r_N_a_m_e et.al. is set. This happens if the event handler that sets
       _v_a_r_N_a_m_e does not complete immediately.  For example, if an event
       handler sets _v_a_r_N_a_m_e and then itself calls vvwwaaiitt to wait for a
       different variable, then it may not return for a long time.  During
       this time the top-level vvwwaaiitt is blocked waiting for the event handler
       to complete, so it cannot return either. (See the NNEESSTTEEDD VVWWAAIITTSS BBYY
       EEXXAAMMPPLLEE below.)

       To be clear, _m_u_l_t_i_p_l_e vvwwaaiitt _c_a_l_l_s _w_i_l_l _n_e_s_t _a_n_d _w_i_l_l _n_o_t _h_a_p_p_e_n _i_n
       _p_a_r_a_l_l_e_l.  The outermost call to vvwwaaiitt will not return until all the
       inner ones do.  It is recommended that code should never nest vvwwaaiitt
       calls (by avoiding putting them in event callbacks) but when that is
       not possible, care should be taken to add interlock variables to the
       code to prevent all reentrant calls to vvwwaaiitt that are not _s_t_r_i_c_t_l_y
       necessary. Be aware that the synchronous modes of operation of some Tcl
       packages (e.g., hhttttpp) use vvwwaaiitt internally; if using the event loop, it
       is best to use the asynchronous callback-based modes of operation of
       those packages where available.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       Run the event-loop continually until some event calls eexxiitt.  (You can
       use any variable not mentioned elsewhere, but the name _f_o_r_e_v_e_r reminds
       you at a glance of the intent.)

              vvwwaaiitt forever

       Wait five seconds for a connection to a server socket, otherwise close
       the socket and continue running the script:

              # Initialise the state
              after 5000 set state timeout
              set server [socket -server accept 12345]
              proc accept {args} {
                  global state connectionInfo
                  set state accepted
                  set connectionInfo $args
              }

              # Wait for something to happen
              vvwwaaiitt state

              # Clean up events that could have happened
              close $server
              after cancel set state timeout

              # Do something based on how the vwait finished...
              switch $state {
                  timeout {
                      puts "no connection on port 12345"
                  }
                  accepted {
                     puts "connection: $connectionInfo"
                     puts [lindex $connectionInfo 0] "Hello there!"
                  }
              }

       A command that will wait for some time delay by waiting for a namespace
       variable to be set.  Includes an interlock to prevent nested waits.

              namespace eval example {
                  variable v done
                  proc wait {delay} {
                      variable v
                      if {$v ne "waiting"} {
                          set v waiting
                          after $delay [namespace code {set v done}]
                          vvwwaaiitt [namespace which -variable v]
                      }
                      return $v
                  }
              }

       When running inside a ccoorroouuttiinnee, an alternative to using vvwwaaiitt is to
       yyiieelldd to an outer event loop and to get recommenced when the variable
       is set, or at an idle moment after that.

              coroutine task apply {{} {
                  # simulate [after 1000]
                  after 1000 [info coroutine]
                  yield

                  # schedule the setting of a global variable, as normal
                  after 2000 {set var 1}

                  # simulate [vvwwaaiitt var]
                  proc updatedVar {task args} {
                      after idle $task
                      trace remove variable ::var write "updatedVar $task"
                  }
                  trace add variable ::var write "updatedVar [info coroutine]"
                  yield
              }}

   NNEESSTTEEDD VVWWAAIITTSS BBYY EEXXAAMMPPLLEE
       This example demonstrates what can happen when the vvwwaaiitt command is
       nested. The script will never finish because the waiting for the _a
       variable never finishes; that vvwwaaiitt command is still waiting for a
       script scheduled with aafftteerr to complete, which just happens to be
       running an inner vvwwaaiitt (for _b) even though the event that the outer
       vvwwaaiitt was waiting for (the setting of _a) has occurred.

              after 500 {
                  puts "waiting for b"
                  vvwwaaiitt b
                  puts "b was set"
              }
              after 1000 {
                  puts "setting a"
                  set a 10
              }
              puts "waiting for a"
              vvwwaaiitt a
              puts "a was set"
              puts "setting b"
              set b 42

       If you run the above code, you get this output:

              waiting for a
              waiting for b
              setting a

       The script will never print “a was set” until after it has printed “b
       was set” because of the nesting of vvwwaaiitt commands, and yet _b will not
       be set until after the outer vvwwaaiitt returns, so the script has
       deadlocked.  The only ways to avoid this are to either structure the
       overall program in continuation-passing style or to use ccoorroouuttiinnee to
       make the continuations implicit. The first of these options would be
       written as:

              after 500 {
                  puts "waiting for b"
                  trace add variable b write {apply {args {
                      global a b
                      trace remove variable ::b write \
                              [lrange [info level 0] 0 1]
                      puts "b was set"
                      set ::done ok
                  }}}
              }
              after 1000 {
                  puts "setting a"
                  set a 10
              }
              puts "waiting for a"
              trace add variable a write {apply {args {
                  global a b
                  trace remove variable a write [lrange [info level 0] 0 1]
                  puts "a was set"
                  puts "setting b"
                  set b 42
              }}}
              vvwwaaiitt done

       The second option, with ccoorroouuttiinnee and some helper procedures, is done
       like this:

              # A coroutine-based wait-for-variable command
              proc waitvar globalVar {
                  trace add variable ::$globalVar write \
                          [list apply {{v c args} {
                      trace remove variable $v write \
                              [lrange [info level 0] 0 3]
                      after 0 $c
                  }} ::$globalVar [info coroutine]]
                  yield
              }
              # A coroutine-based wait-for-some-time command
              proc waittime ms {
                  after $ms [info coroutine]
                  yield
              }

              coroutine task-1 eval {
                  puts "waiting for a"
                  waitvar a

                  puts "setting b"
                  set b 42
              }
              coroutine task-2 eval {

                  puts "waiting for b"
                  waitvar b
                  puts "b was set"
                  set done ok
              }
              coroutine task-3 eval {
                  waittime 1000
                  puts "setting a"
                  set a 10
