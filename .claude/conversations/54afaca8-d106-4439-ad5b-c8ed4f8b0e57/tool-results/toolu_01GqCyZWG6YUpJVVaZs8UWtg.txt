       This command is used to bring the application “up to date” by entering
       the event loop repeatedly until all pending events (including idle
       callbacks) have been processed.

       If the iiddlleettaasskkss keyword is specified as an argument to the command,
       then no new events or errors are processed;  only idle callbacks are
       invoked.  This causes operations that are normally deferred, such as
       display updates and window layout calculations, to be performed
       immediately.

       The uuppddaattee iiddlleettaasskkss command is useful in scripts where changes have
       been made to the application's state and you want those changes to
       appear on the display immediately, rather than waiting for the script
       to complete.  Most display updates are performed as idle callbacks, so
       uuppddaattee iiddlleettaasskkss will cause them to run.  However, there are some kinds
       of updates that only happen in response to events, such as those
       triggered by window size changes; these updates will not occur in
       uuppddaattee iiddlleettaasskkss.

       The uuppddaattee command with no options is useful in scripts where you are
       performing a long-running computation but you still want the
       application to respond to events such as user interactions;  if you
       occasionally call uuppddaattee then user input will be processed during the
       next call to uuppddaattee.

       Run computations for about a second and then finish:

              set x 1000
              set done 0
              after 1000 set done 1
              while {!$done} {
                  # A very silly example!
                  set x [expr {log($x) ** 2.8}]

                  # Test to see if our time-limit has been hit.  This would
                  # also give a chance for serving network sockets and, if
                  # the Tk package is loaded, updating a user interface.
                  uuppddaattee
