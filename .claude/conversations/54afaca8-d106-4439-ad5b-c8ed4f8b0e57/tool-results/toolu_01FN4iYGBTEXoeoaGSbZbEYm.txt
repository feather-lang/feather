DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This command is used to delay execution of the program or to execute a
       command in background sometime in the future.  It has several forms,
       depending on the first argument to the command:

       aafftteerr _m_s
              _M_s must be an integer giving a time in milliseconds.  A negative
              number is treated as 0.  The command sleeps for _m_s milliseconds
              and then returns.  While the command is sleeping the application
              does not respond to events.

       aafftteerr _m_s ?_s_c_r_i_p_t _s_c_r_i_p_t _s_c_r_i_p_t _._._.?
              In this form the command returns immediately, but it arranges
              for a Tcl command to be executed _m_s milliseconds later as an
              event handler.  The command will be executed exactly once, at
              the given time.  The delayed command is formed by concatenating
              all the _s_c_r_i_p_t arguments in the same fashion as the ccoonnccaatt
              command.  The command will be executed at global level (outside
              the context of any Tcl procedure).  If an error occurs while
              executing the delayed command then the background error will be
              reported by the command registered with iinntteerrpp bbggeerrrroorr.  The
              aafftteerr command returns an identifier that can be used to cancel
              the delayed command using aafftteerr ccaanncceell.  A _m_s value of 0 (or
              negative) queues the event immediately with priority over other
              event types (if not installed with an event proc, which will
              wait for next round of events).

       aafftteerr ccaanncceell _i_d
              Cancels the execution of a delayed command that was previously
              scheduled.  _I_d indicates which command should be canceled;  it
              must have been the return value from a previous aafftteerr command.
              If the command given by _i_d has already been executed then the
              aafftteerr ccaanncceell command has no effect.

       aafftteerr ccaanncceell _s_c_r_i_p_t _s_c_r_i_p_t _._._.
              This command also cancels the execution of a delayed command.
              The _s_c_r_i_p_t arguments are concatenated together with space
              separators (just as in the ccoonnccaatt command).  If there is a
              pending command that matches the string, it is canceled and will
              never be executed;  if no such command is currently pending then
              the aafftteerr ccaanncceell command has no effect.

       aafftteerr iiddllee _s_c_r_i_p_t ?_s_c_r_i_p_t _s_c_r_i_p_t _._._.?
              Concatenates the _s_c_r_i_p_t arguments together with space separators
              (just as in the ccoonnccaatt command), and arranges for the resulting
              script to be evaluated later as an idle callback.  The script
              will be run exactly once, the next time the event loop is
              entered and there are no events to process.  The command returns
              an identifier that can be used to cancel the delayed command
              using aafftteerr ccaanncceell.  If an error occurs while executing the
              script then the background error will be reported by the command
              registered with iinntteerrpp bbggeerrrroorr.

       aafftteerr iinnffoo ?_i_d?
              This command returns information about existing event handlers.
              If no _i_d argument is supplied, the command returns a list of the
              identifiers for all existing event handlers created by the aafftteerr
              command for this interpreter.  If _i_d is supplied, it specifies
              an existing handler; _i_d must have been the return value from
              some previous call to aafftteerr and it must not have triggered yet
              or been canceled.  In this case the command returns a list with
              two elements.  The first element of the list is the script
              associated with _i_d, and the second element is either iiddllee or
              ttiimmeerr to indicate what kind of event handler it is.

       The aafftteerr _m_s and aafftteerr iiddllee forms of the command assume that the
       application is event driven:  the delayed commands will not be executed
       unless the application enters the event loop.  In applications that are
       not normally event-driven, such as ttccllsshh, the event loop can be entered
       with the vvwwaaiitt and uuppddaattee commands.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       This defines a command to make Tcl do nothing at all for _N seconds:

              proc sleep {N} {
                  aafftteerr [expr {int($N * 1000)}]
              }

       This arranges for the command _w_a_k_e___u_p to be run in eight hours
       (providing the event loop is active at that time):

              aafftteerr [expr {1000 * 60 * 60 * 8}] wake_up

       The following command can be used to do long-running calculations (as
       represented here by _:_:_m_y___c_a_l_c_:_:_o_n_e___s_t_e_p, which is assumed to return a
       boolean indicating whether another step should be performed) in a step-
       by-step fashion, though the calculation itself needs to be arranged so
       it can work step-wise.  This technique is extra careful to ensure that
       the event loop is not starved by the rescheduling of processing steps
       (arranging for the next step to be done using an already-triggered
       timer event only when the event queue has been drained) and is useful
       when you want to ensure that a Tk GUI remains responsive during a slow
       task.

              proc doOneStep {} {
                  if {[::my_calc::one_step]} {
                      aafftteerr iiddllee [list aafftteerr 0 doOneStep]
                  }
              }
              doOneStep
