       This command enters the Tcl event loop to process events, blocking the
       application if no events are ready.  It continues processing events
       until some event handler sets the value of the global variable _v_a_r_N_a_m_e.
       Once _v_a_r_N_a_m_e has been set, the vvwwaaiitt command will return as soon as the
       event handler that modified _v_a_r_N_a_m_e completes.  The _v_a_r_N_a_m_e argument is
       always interpreted as a variable name with respect to the global
       namespace, but can refer to any namespace's variables if the fully-
       qualified name is given.

       In the second more complex command form _o_p_t_i_o_n_s allow for finer control
       of the wait operation and to deal with multiple event sources.  _O_p_t_i_o_n_s
       can be made up of:

       ----     Marks the end of options. All following arguments are handled as
              variable names.

       --aallll   All conditions for the wait operation must be met to complete
              the wait operation. Otherwise (the default) the first event
              completes the wait.

       --eexxtteennddeedd
              An extended result in list form is returned, see below for
              explanation.

       --nnooffiilleeeevveennttss
              File events are not handled in the wait operation.

       --nnooiiddlleeeevveennttss
              Idle handlers are not invoked during the wait operation.

       --nnoottiimmeerreevveennttss
              Timer handlers are not serviced during the wait operation.

       --nnoowwiinnddoowweevveennttss
              Events of the windowing system are not handled during the wait
              operation.

       --rreeaaddaabbllee _c_h_a_n_n_e_l
              _C_h_a_n_n_e_l must name a Tcl channel open for reading. If _c_h_a_n_n_e_l is
              or becomes readable the wait operation completes.

       --ttiimmeeoouutt _m_i_l_l_i_s_e_c_o_n_d_s
              The wait operation is constrained to _m_i_l_l_i_s_e_c_o_n_d_s.

       --vvaarriiaabbllee _v_a_r_N_a_m_e
              _V_a_r_N_a_m_e must be the name of a global variable. Writing or
              unsetting this variable completes the wait operation.

       --wwrriittaabbllee _c_h_a_n_n_e_l
              _C_h_a_n_n_e_l must name a Tcl channel open for writing. If _c_h_a_n_n_e_l is
              or becomes writable the wait operation completes.

       The result returned by vvwwaaiitt is for the simple form an empty string. If
       the --ttiimmeeoouutt option is specified, the result is the number of
       milliseconds remaining when the wait condition has been met, or -1 if
       the wait operation timed out.

       If the --eexxtteennddeedd option is specified, the result is made up of a Tcl
       list with an even number of elements. Odd elements take the values
       rreeaaddaabbllee, ttiimmeelleefftt, vvaarriiaabbllee, and wwrriittaabbllee. Even elements are the
       corresponding variable and channel names or the remaining number of
       milliseconds.  The list is ordered by the occurrences of the event(s)
       with the exception of ttiimmeelleefftt which always comes last.

       In some cases the vvwwaaiitt command may not return immediately after
       _v_a_r_N_a_m_e et.al. is set. This happens if the event handler that sets
       _v_a_r_N_a_m_e does not complete immediately.  For example, if an event
       handler sets _v_a_r_N_a_m_e and then itself calls vvwwaaiitt to wait for a
       different variable, then it may not return for a long time.  During
       this time the top-level vvwwaaiitt is blocked waiting for the event handler
       to complete, so it cannot return either. (See the NNEESSTTEEDD VVWWAAIITTSS BBYY
       EEXXAAMMPPLLEE below.)

       To be clear, _m_u_l_t_i_p_l_e vvwwaaiitt _c_a_l_l_s _w_i_l_l _n_e_s_t _a_n_d _w_i_l_l _n_o_t _h_a_p_p_e_n _i_n
       _p_a_r_a_l_l_e_l.  The outermost call to vvwwaaiitt will not return until all the
       inner ones do.  It is recommended that code should never nest vvwwaaiitt
       calls (by avoiding putting them in event callbacks) but when that is
       not possible, care should be taken to add interlock variables to the
       code to prevent all reentrant calls to vvwwaaiitt that are not _s_t_r_i_c_t_l_y
       necessary. Be aware that the synchronous modes of operation of some Tcl
       packages (e.g., hhttttpp) use vvwwaaiitt internally; if using the event loop, it
       is best to use the asynchronous callback-based modes of operation of
       those packages where available.
