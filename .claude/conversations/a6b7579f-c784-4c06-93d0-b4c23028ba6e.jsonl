Now I have comprehensive information. Let me provide you with a complete guide on creating custom skills in Claude Code.\n\n## What is a Skill in Claude Code?\n\nA **Skill** is a modular capability that extends Claude's functionality by packaging expertise into discoverable capabilities. Unlike slash commands (which you explicitly invoke), Skills are **model-invoked**—Claude automatically decides when to use them based on your request and the Skill's description.\n\nKey difference: Skills are discovered intelligently by Claude when relevant to your task, while slash commands require explicit user activation (typing `/command`).\n\n## How Skills Are Structured\n\nSkills are stored as directories containing a required `SKILL.md` file and optional supporting files:\n\n```\nmy-skill-name/\n├── SKILL.md                 (required)\n├── reference.md             (optional)\n├── examples.md              (optional)\n├── scripts/\n│   └── helper.py\n└── templates/\n    └── template.txt\n```\n\n### Storage Locations\n\nThere are three scopes for Skills:\n\n1. **Personal Skills** (available across all projects):\n   ```bash\n   ~/.claude/skills/my-skill-name/\n   ```\n\n2. **Project Skills** (shared with your team via git):\n   ```bash\n   .claude/skills/my-skill-name/\n   ```\n\n3. **Plugin Skills** (bundled with installed plugins, automatic)\n\n## SKILL.md Format\n\nYour `SKILL.md` file must include YAML frontmatter followed by Markdown content:\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: your-skill-name\ndescription: Brief description of what this Skill does and when to use it\n---\n\n# Your Skill Name\n\n## Instructions\nProvide clear, step-by-step guidance for Claude.\n\n## Examples\nShow concrete examples of using this Skill.\n```\n\n### Frontmatter Fields\n\n**Required fields**:\n\n- `name`: Must use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only (max 64 characters)\n- `description`: Brief description of what the Skill does **and when Claude should use it** (max 1024 characters)\n\n**Optional field**:\n\n- `allowed-tools`: Restricts which tools Claude can use when this Skill is active (useful for read-only Skills or security-sensitive workflows)\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: safe-file-reader\ndescription: Read files without making changes. Use when you need read-only file access.\nallowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob\n---\n```\n\nWhen `allowed-tools` is specified, Claude can use only those tools without asking for permission.\n\n## Best Practices for Writing Skills\n\n### 1. Write Specific, Discoverable Descriptions\n\nThe description is critical for Claude to know when to use your Skill. Include both **what** it does and **when** to use it.\n\n**Vague** (won't work well):\n```yaml\ndescription: Helps with documents\n```\n\n**Specific** (Claude will discover it):\n```yaml\ndescription: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.\n```\n\n### 2. Keep Skills Focused\n\nOne Skill should address one capability:\n\n**Good**:\n- \"PDF form filling\"\n- \"Excel data analysis\"\n- \"Git commit messages\"\n\n**Too broad** (split into separate Skills):\n- \"Document processing\"\n- \"Data tools\"\n\n### 3. Provide Clear Instructions and Examples\n\n```markdown\n## Instructions\n1. Step-by-step guidance\n2. Clear requirements\n3. Edge cases to handle\n\n## Examples\nShow concrete usage examples so Claude understands how to apply the Skill.\n```\n\n### 4. Document Dependencies\n\nList required packages in your description:\n\n```yaml\ndescription: Analyze Excel spreadsheets, create pivot tables, and generate charts. Use when working with Excel files. Requires openpyxl and pandas packages.\n```\n\n### 5. Use Progressive Disclosure\n\nReference additional files from SKILL.md so Claude loads them only when needed:\n\n````markdown\nFor advanced usage, see [reference.md](reference.md).\n\nRun the helper script:\n```bash\npython scripts/helper.py input.txt\n```\n````\n\n## Practical Example: Multi-File Skill\n\nHere's a complete PDF processing Skill with multiple files:\n\n**Directory structure**:\n```\npdf-processing/\n├── SKILL.md\n├── FORMS.md\n├── REFERENCE.md\n└── scripts/\n    ├── fill_form.py\n    └── validate.py\n```\n\n**SKILL.md**:\n```yaml\n---\nname: pdf-processing\ndescription: Extract text, fill forms, merge PDFs. Use when working with PDF files, forms, or document extraction. Requires pypdf and pdfplumber packages.\n---\n\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n\nExtract text:\n```python\nimport pdfplumber\nwith pdfplumber.open(\"doc.pdf\") as pdf:\n    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()\n```\n\nFor form filling, see [FORMS.md](FORMS.md).\nFor detailed API reference, see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).\n\n## Requirements\n\nPackages must be installed:\n```bash\npip install pypdf pdfplumber\n```\n```\n\n## Creating Your First Skill\n\n1. **Create the directory**:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p .claude/skills/my-skill-name\n   ```\n\n2. **Write SKILL.md** with your frontmatter and instructions\n\n3. **Test it** by asking Claude relevant questions—it should automatically use your Skill\n\n4. **Debug** by checking:\n   - Is the description specific enough?\n   - Is the YAML syntax valid?\n   - Is the file at the correct path?\n   - Run `claude --debug` to see loading errors\n\n5. **Share with team** (Project Skills):\n   ```bash\n   git add .claude/skills/\n   git commit -m \"Add team Skill for PDF processing\"\n   git push\n   ```\n\nTeam members automatically get your Skill when they pull the changes.\n\n## Key Takeaway\n\nSkills are powerful for packaging domain expertise. The secret to making them work well is writing **specific descriptions that tell Claude when to use the Skill**, combined with **clear, focused instructions** that guide Claude through the task.\n\nYour current project has several custom Skills already configured (like `/agg`, `/gws`, and `/write-news-post`). You can use these as references for your own Skill creations."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a953b9b (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"uuid":"86f4ca2c-d47a-4c18-9b0f-ffb93d238c8d","timestamp":"2025-12-20T22:50:42.000Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need to create a custom skill for Claude Code.
