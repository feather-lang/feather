I've reviewed the context and understand:\n\n1. **tclc** is an embeddable TCL interpreter written in stdlib-less C\n2. The project is organized as:\n   - `src/` - the interpreter implementation\n   - `harness/` - test harness directory\n   - `bin/` - compiled binaries\n3. It uses `mise` for building and testing\n4. Tests are data-driven, described in XML/HTML files\n5. The public API is defined in `src/tclc.h`\n6. Development follows TDD with progressive test complexity\n\nKey architectural points:\n- All memory/I/O is managed by the embedder through `TclHostOps`\n- The interpreter is pure - no direct kernel interaction\n- Currently working through roadmap milestones (M1-M7 visible, focused on basic commands, expressions, and control flow)\n\nI'm in read-only mode and can efficiently search and analyze the codebase using:\n- **Glob** for file pattern matching\n- **Grep** for content searching with regex\n- **Read** for viewing specific files\n- **Bash** for read-only operations only\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or analyze in the tclc codebase?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":7943,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":7943,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWJiceqnEc1EANpWNLEqt","type":"assistant","uuid":"edd04030-06d2-4b7e-993f-e6f8f6e7f94c","timestamp":"2025-12-20T22:21:09.922Z"}
